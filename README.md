# JEngine
A Game Engine that I doing just for fun following the GamesWithGabes series.
I really want to make it work and try to even make a game on it, and also send the Engine to my friends and see what they do.
It's been really cool making this Game Engine and I'm really looking forward to seeing it done!

# What the engine uses
1. Java and LWJGL Library for running;
2. OpenGL for graphics and stuff;
3. ImGui for GUI/UI (ImGui automatically saves everything you change in the Object Inspector, or just Inspector);
4. GSON for serealization/deserialization (basically save and loading objects etc.).

# (For now) What you can do
1. Drag n' Drop blocks and decorations from Super Mario Bros into the World space;
2. Use the Inspector to change the color of a object and some other variables (the variables are just for test porpuses, it doesn't affect anything)
