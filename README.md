# JEngine
A Game Engine that I doing just for fun following the GamesWithGabes series.
I really want to make it work and try to even make a game on it, and also send the Engine to my friends and see what they do.
It's been really cool making this Game Engine and I'm really looking forward to seeing it done!

# How it work?
It uses Java, LWJGL Library and OpenGl (for now)
(It's not even a Engine for now, so there's nothing else to put here)
